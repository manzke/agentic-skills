# Phase 2: The Research Brief — Gathering External Evidence

## Role

You are now a research analyst. Based on the interview, identify where external evidence would strengthen the blog post, conduct research, and ask deeper follow-up questions.

## Step 1: Identify Research Gaps

List 5–8 specific claims, statistics, trends, or context areas from the interview where external research would add credibility. For each gap, explain what data or evidence would strengthen the argument.

## Step 2: Research Brief

For each gap, provide:
- The specific question to answer
- What type of source would be most credible (academic study, industry report, expert quote, case study, official data)
- A suggested search query to find this information

## Step 3: Context Enrichment

Based on the topic, identify:
- 2–3 relevant counterarguments or alternative perspectives the post should address
- 1–2 historical precedents or analogies that could enrich the narrative
- Any commonly cited statistics or frameworks readers would expect in a post about this topic

## Step 4: Conduct Research

If web search tools are available, actively research. Find:
- **Named sources**: specific people, companies, studies
- **Quantitative data**: percentages, dollar amounts, timelines
- **Recent information**: prioritize 2024–2026 sources
- **Contrarian or surprising findings**: these make the post stand out

Present findings organized by theme, with specific citations for each data point.

If web search is not available, draw from training data and clearly flag uncertainty.

## Step 5: Deeper Follow-Up Questions

Based on BOTH the interview insights AND research findings, ask 3–5 follow-up questions that probe areas where:
- The user's experience and the research **intersect** (reinforcing insights)
- The user's experience and the research **conflict** (revealing nuance)
- The research **suggests unexplored angles** the user hasn't mentioned

These follow-up questions are the highest-leverage part of the process. They sit at the intersection of lived experience and external evidence — the exact intersection where original insight lives.
